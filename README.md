# Web Data Analysis & Comparison

This is an web based application developed in raw PHP for market analysis and prediction. It also used web crawling for comparing the price of various products with other websites products.
Here, I have used the concept of web crawling for fetching and parsing data from other websites as I don't have access to their database. I have used Gradient Descent as prediction algorirhm for product's quantity prediction depending on some predictor variables.
